# Engineering Design 1 - Portable Ramp Project

First year software engineering project where we built a portable ramp made out of cardboard to accommodate users who require assistants 
getting over the edge for walking or wheelchair access.

This project taught us how to get started working in a engineering student team, writing engineering reports, and presenting our prototype and research.
